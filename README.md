# Adventum
An inform 6 text adventure exported as a .z5 file.
What's what:
- Adventum.z5 is the compiled game that works on all operating systems as long as you have a z-code interpreter. For Windows, I recommend Windows Frotz, and for Mac, I recomend Yazmin.
- The two nano.saves are just saves that I use for jumping to different spots in the story. You should ignore them.
- Adventum.inf is the source code for the game, written in inform 6. However, if you want to compile the game yourself, don't use your standard inform 6 library, use the one I uploaded here on github. More on that later.
- Inform6lib-master(the folder) is the inform 6 library that I modified for the game. I know you aren't really supposed to do that(at least according to Roger Firth), but it just makes it easier.
- compiler.bat and compiler.sh are the compiler files(which basically tell the compiler what to do) for the Windows and Mac compilers, respectively.
- Adventum.command is the compiler for Mac.
- inform6.exe is the compiler for Windows.

...And thats that.
